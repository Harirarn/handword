handword
========
What is this program supposed to do?
First of all it can draw images of letters. To make it look like handwritten,
it adds a bit of randomness to the length, orientation, curvature and position
of strokes.

This project will contain:
handword.py
a few .hw files which specify characters.

immediate TODO/DONE list:

1. create handword.py (DONE)
  1.1 method to draw lines and save into file
  1.2 method to read .hw files (Consider moving this function to different file)
  1.3 method to (randomly) make the lines from instructions in .hw files

2. create a few .hw files
  2.1 start with lowercase English. ('a' DONE)
